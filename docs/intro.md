This is the REST API implementation, which provides information about vacancies for positions of programmers in various cities.

The following stories are implemented:
1) As an API user, I need to obtain information about a specific position by its ID
2) As an API user, I want to find all positions at a specific location (by city or by country) and be able to sort (by seniority level and salary (ascending only))
3) As an API user, I want to obtain the most relevant position for a candidate with a certain set of skills
